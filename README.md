🚀 How It Works

1. User enters a location or clicks "Use My Location" to detect their current coordinates.


2. The app fetches data from weatherapi.com via a proxy to handle CORS.


3. The current temperature, weather condition, and a forecast for the next 7 days are displayed.


4. Background visuals update according to weather type (e.g., raining animation for rainy days).


5. Alerts are shown for wind speeds above 30 km/h or if rain is expected.
